Throughout the paper, all vectors are column vectors and are represented by
bold lowercase letters (e.g., $\bm{u}$). Matrices are represented by upper
case letters (e.g., ${R,U,V}$).

The historical preference information is represented by a preference matrix $R$.
Each row in ${R}$ corresponds to a user and each column corresponds to an item. 
The entries of $R$ indicates  the users' preferences on the items. 
The preference given by the user $u$ for the item $i$ is represented by entry $r_{u,i}$ in $R$.  
The symbol $\tilde{r}_{u,i}$ represents the score predicted by the model for the actual
preference $r_{u,i}$.

Sets are represented with calligraphic letters. The set of items $\mathcal{S}$
has size $|S|$.
