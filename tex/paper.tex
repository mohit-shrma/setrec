Existing item recommendation methods rely on a user's preferences on the items
consumed in the past. However, it is not easy to elicit the user's preferences
on each and every item to improve the recommendation to user, particularly when
we have a large number of items. In this paper, we present a method to elicit
the user's preference on a set of items rather than on the items that constitute
the set and use this preference on the set to estimate the preference of the
constituting items. This method, compared to the process in which the user has
to provide his/her preference for the individual items, can quickly gather the
user's preferences on a few sets that span a large number of items. In the
experiments on the real world data, we show that the estimated preferences on
the individual items from these sets are comparable to the preferences when
estimated using the individual preference on the items.
